Hi, I am Xinhao Kong. I finished my bachelor degree at Computer Science department of Peking University (2016-2020) and I am going to pursue my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Duke University, under Prof. [Danyang Zhuo](https://danyangzhuo.com/)'s supervision. During my undergraduate years, I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Kai Chen](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/) at HKUST and Prof. [Guangyu Sun](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/info/1504/6956.htm) at PKU.

Research Interest 
======
My research interest lies in the area of system and networking. I enjoy building large-scale systems and handling system-level technical details. More specifically, I am diving into these areas: 
- Data center networks
- High-performance distributed systems.
- RDMA networking

Days on my past
======
I was born in Shenzhen, Guangdong, a coastal city in South China. In 2016, I was admitted to Computer Science department of Peking University. After the first two years of my undergraduate study, I discovered my interest in system and networking, especially data center networks. In 2019, I exchanged to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and worked as a research assistant under Prof. Kai Chen's supervision. At HKUST, I participated in a RDMA-related project, which motivates me to further research on how to build large-scale system that can provide high-performance. Therefore, after finshing that project and back to Peking Univeristy, I joined ByteDance and work as a system engineer intern until now.
