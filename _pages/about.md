Hi, I am Xinhao Kong. I finished my bachelor degree at Computer Science department of Peking University (2016-2020) and I am going to pursue my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Duke University, under Prof. [Danyang Zhuo](https://danyangzhuo.com/)'s supervision. During my undergraduate years, I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Kai Chen](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/) at HKUST.

Research Interest 
======
My research interest lies in the area of system and networking. I enjoy building large-scale systems and handling system-level technical details. More specifically, I am diving into these areas: 
- Data center networks
- Kernel-bypass techniques (e.g., RDMA)

Days on my past
======
I was born in Shenzhen, Guangdong, a coastal city in South China. In 2016, I was admitted to Computer Science department of Peking University. After the first two years of my undergraduate study, I discovered my interest in system and networking, especially data center networks. In 2019, I exchanged to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and worked as a research assistant under Prof. Kai Chen's supervision. At HKUST, I participated in a RDMA-related project, which motivates me to further research on how to build large-scale system that can provide high-performance. Therefore, after finshing that project and back to Peking Univeristy, I joined ByteDance and worked as a system engineer. I was admitted to Duke Unversity in 2020 and I deferred my offer to Fall 2021 due to the COVID-2019. Now I work as a network engineer in ByteDance and plan to go to Duke in 2021 Fall.
